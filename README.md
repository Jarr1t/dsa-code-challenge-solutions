# 🧠 NeetCode Solutions – Problem Solving by Topic & Difficulty

This repository contains my personal solutions to coding challenges from [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), and other platforms — organized by **data structure or algorithm topic**, then grouped by **difficulty level**.

My goal is to strengthen my data structures and algorithms skills, improve problem-solving efficiency, and stay consistent with daily practice.
